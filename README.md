# team-member-webpage-generator

## This application takes information about employees via inquirer, and generates employee cards for them. Those employee cards are then appended to an html file that can display each of the cards.
<br/>
<h3>The questions are asked through the command line, and can be looped through via a confirmation question. This is demonstrated below.</h3>
